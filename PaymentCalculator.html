            <h2>Payment Calculator</h2><br>
            <p>The Payment Calculator helps you estimate your monthly loan payments based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Introduction:</h3><br>
            <p>Using this calculator, you can determine how much you need to pay each month to fully repay your loan within the specified term.</p>
            <br>
           <h3>Calculator Principle:</h3><br>
           <p>This calculator uses the standard amortization formula to calculate the monthly payment amount for a fixed-rate loan.</p>
           <br>
           <p>By entering your specific loan information, you can obtain a personalized monthly payment estimate.</p>
           <br>
           <p>Using this calculator can help you plan your finances more effectively and understand the impact of different loan terms and interest rates.</p>
           <br>
           <h3>How to Use the Calculator:</h3><br>
           <p>Using the Payment Calculator is straightforward. Here's a basic guide:</p>
           <ol>
               <li>Enter the loan amount.</li>
               <li>Input the annual interest rate.</li>
               <li>Specify the loan term in years.</li>
               <li>Click the "Calculate Payment" button to obtain your monthly payment amount.</li>
           </ol>
           <br>
           <h3>Example Applications:</h3><br>
           <p>To better understand how the calculator works, let's consider a few example applications:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>A $20,000 loan with a 5% annual interest rate for a term of 5 years.</li>
               <li>A $100,000 loan with a 3.5% annual interest rate for a term of 30 years.</li>
           </ul>
           <br>
           <h3>Conclusion:</h3><br>
           <p>The Payment Calculator is a useful tool for anyone interested in understanding their monthly loan payments. By familiarizing yourself with its features and usage, you can obtain reliable and accurate payment estimates to suit your needs.

           <br>
