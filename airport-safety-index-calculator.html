            <h2>Understanding Airport Safety Index and Its Importance</h2><br>
            <p>The Airport Safety Index Calculator provides an insightful assessment of airport safety by combining multiple key factors such as historical accident rates, security screening effectiveness, geographic risk levels, and operational performance. This comprehensive index helps travelers, aviation professionals, and regulatory bodies evaluate and compare safety levels across major airports worldwide.</p>

            <h3>What is the Airport Safety Index?</h3><br>
            <p>The Airport Safety Index is a composite score that quantifies how safe an airport is based on a variety of metrics that influence air travel safety. This index considers past accident occurrences, efficiency of security protocols, the risks posed by the airport’s geographical location, and the overall operational quality of the airport. A higher safety index score indicates a safer airport with robust safety measures and lower risk factors.</p>

            <h3>Key Factors Affecting Airport Safety</h3><br>
            <p><strong>1. Historical Accident Rate:</strong> This factor measures the frequency of accidents per 100,000 flights associated with the airport. A low accident rate indicates effective safety management and fewer incidents. Historical data from aviation safety databases provide the basis for this metric.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Security Screening Effectiveness:</strong> Airports implement varying levels of passenger and baggage screening. An effective screening process reduces threats from unauthorized items or individuals, greatly enhancing passenger safety. Scores range from 1 (low effectiveness) to 10 (high effectiveness).</p>

            <p><strong>3. Geographic Risk Level:</strong> Airports situated in regions prone to adverse weather, natural disasters, or geopolitical instability may face higher safety risks. This factor rates geographic-related hazards on a scale of 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk).</p>

            <p><strong>4. Operational Performance:</strong> This includes air traffic control efficiency, runway maintenance, emergency response preparedness, and overall airport management. Better operational performance supports safer airport environments and smoother flight operations.</p>

            <h3>How Does the Calculator Work?</h3><br>
            <p>The calculator uses a weighted formula to integrate the above factors into a single safety index score. The formula is designed to reflect realistic influences on airport safety, giving higher weight to accident history and security screening, while also considering geographic risks and operational performance.</p>

            <p><em>Formula:</em></p>
            <pre style="background:#f4f4f4; padding:10px; border-radius:6px;">
Airport Safety Index = 100 ×
  (1 - Historical Accident Rate) ×
  (Security Screening Effectiveness / 10) ×
  (1 - Geographic Risk Level / 10) ×
  (Operational Performance / 10)
            </pre>

            <p>Each factor is normalized to a 0 to 1 scale to allow a balanced combination. The final score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate safer airports.</p>

            <h3>Using the Airport Safety Index Calculator</h3><br>
            <p>To use this tool, select the airport you are interested in from the dropdown menu. Input the latest or estimated historical accident rate per 100,000 flights, a number reflecting the safety record of that airport. Then, rate the effectiveness of the airport’s security screening, geographic risk, and operational performance on a scale from 1 to 10, where higher values typically represent better safety measures or more risk depending on the factor.</p>

            <p>Once all values are entered, click the "Calculate Safety Index" button. The calculator will provide an estimated safety index score, giving you a clear idea of how that airport ranks in terms of safety.</p>

            <h3>Why Is Airport Safety Important?</h3><br>
            <p>Air travel safety remains one of the highest priorities in aviation. Airports play a critical role in maintaining that safety through well-maintained infrastructure, stringent security measures, and efficient operational management. A high safety index reflects an airport’s commitment to protecting passengers and minimizing risks.</p>

            <p>Travelers can use the Airport Safety Index as a reference to better understand the safety profiles of airports they fly through or connect at. Airlines and regulatory agencies may also use such indices to target improvements, allocate resources, and establish safety standards.</p>

            <h3>Additional Considerations</h3><br>
            <p>While this calculator provides an informative overview, it should be combined with other travel safety measures such as airline safety records, pilot training, and in-flight safety protocols. The airport environment is one of many factors contributing to overall flight safety.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
            <p>The Airport Safety Index Calculator is a practical tool designed to quantify airport safety by integrating key metrics that impact flight security and risk. It empowers users with knowledge to make informed travel decisions and supports ongoing efforts to enhance airport safety worldwide. By understanding the factors influencing safety and utilizing reliable data, the aviation industry and travelers can collaboratively improve air travel safety standards.</p>
