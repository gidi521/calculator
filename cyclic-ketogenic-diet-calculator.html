            <h2>Understanding the Cyclic Ketogenic Diet</h2><br>
            <p>
                The Cyclic Ketogenic Diet (CKD) is a dietary strategy that alternates periods of low-carbohydrate intake with short periods of high-carbohydrate consumption, typically aligned with training intensity and recovery needs. Unlike the Standard Ketogenic Diet, CKD is designed specifically for athletes and individuals engaging in high-intensity or strength training exercises.
            </p><br>

            <h3>What is the Purpose of CKD?</h3><br>
            <p>
                The main purpose of CKD is to optimize fat burning and muscle recovery. By restricting carbs on most days, the body remains in ketosis—burning fat as its primary fuel source. During carb refeed days, glycogen stores are replenished, supporting energy needs for intense workouts and promoting muscle repair.
            </p><br>

            <h3>How the Cyclic Ketogenic Diet Calculator Works</h3><br>
            <p>
                This calculator estimates your recommended carbohydrate intake for both your low-carb (keto) and high-carb (refeed) days. It factors in your body weight, goals (maintenance, fat loss, or muscle gain), and the number of intense training days you perform each week.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Body Weight:</strong> Helps estimate your baseline nutritional requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Determines the caloric surplus or deficit for optimal results.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Days:</strong> Indicates how often you will need refeed days to replenish glycogen.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h3>Example Output</h3><br>
            <p>
                For a 70kg individual training 4 days a week and aiming for muscle gain, the calculator may suggest approximately:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-Carb Days: ~30g carbs, ~140g fat, ~140g protein</li>
                <li>High-Carb Days: ~250g carbs, reduced fat, ~140g protein</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h3>Benefits of CKD</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved athletic performance due to replenished glycogen</li>
                <li>Continued fat loss during low-carb phases</li>
                <li>Hormonal balance and mental clarity</li>
                <li>Flexibility and sustainability for active individuals</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h3>When to Use Refeed Days</h3><br>
            <p>
                Refeed days are typically scheduled around your most intense training sessions—such as leg day or long-duration cardio. Depending on your training frequency, you may schedule 1–2 refeed days per week.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Disclaimer</h3><br>
            <p>
                This calculator provides general estimates based on typical macronutrient ratios used in CKD. Always consult a medical or nutrition professional before making significant dietary changes, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.
